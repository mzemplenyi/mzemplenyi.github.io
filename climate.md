A large portion of my doctoral research focused on studying the _effects_ of air pollution on human health. Next, I want my work to _target the source_ of this air pollution, as well as so many of the other ailments afflicting our health and our planet's health: human activities that cause climate change. Air pollution is released from coal combustion and car exhaust, as well as forest fires worsened by extreme heat and drought like the ones that ravaged Australia earlier this year.  Whether its individual health issues like asthma, heat stroke, and novel infectious disease or problems on a global scale like sea level rise, ocean acidification, and loss of biodiversity, climate change plays a role in them all.  
  
Over the past two years I have gotten involved with climate-focused groups and initiatives like the Harvard Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment (C-CHANGE), the Harvard Forward campaign, the Graduate Environmental Action Team, and the Harvard Science Policy Group. I have also attended workshops and speaker events like those listed below to further my education on climate, energy, and sustainability issues.
