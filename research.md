My doctoral research focused on two different topics: (1) statistical methods for environmental health and epidemiology, and (2) experimental design methods for inferring causal structure. I am also involved in collaborations with Dr. Theresa Chen's research group at Massachusetts Eye and Ear to investigate how three-dimensional imaging of the eye can be used to detect glaucoma progression.

It is becoming increasingly clear that environmental exposures early in life have the potential to set the health trajectory for the rest of your life. My research has focused on statistical methods for identifying windows of susceptibility to environmental exposures -- that is, time periods when there is a significant association between an exposure and an adverse health outcome.  
  
  
In particular, I have focused on the effects of prenatal exposure to air pollution on human health. Inhaling these particles can cause downstream changes in the epigenome, the chemical signals that regulate how genes are expressed. Depending on the timing of these shocks, epigenetic modifications could lead to abnormal organ development and potentially cardiovascular and respiratory problems. These detrimental effects are not limited to the person who directly inhales the air pollution; a developing fetus can be exposed prenatally when the air pollution a pregnant mother inhales triggers a cascade of inflammatory chemical signals that are passed to the fetus via the placenta.  My work on function-on-function regression and sparse canonical correlation analysis aims to identify regions in the epigenome and time periods during pregnancy when these potentially harmful developmental changes occur.

The goal of this work is to help researchers save time and resources by optimizing the experimental process. This is especially useful for biological applications in which a scientist wants to use gene-knockout experiments to learn about the regulatory relationships operating within a gene network. Different experiments yield different amounts of information about the system being studied; the Bayesian optimal experimental design approach that my advisor, Jeff Miller, and I developed identifies the next best experiment to run given any prior results and knowledge about the system. By iterating between experimentation and analysis, and updating knowledge along the way, this cyclical approach maximizes learning and discovery.

<center> <strong style="font-size: 135%;"> Causal mediation analysis </strong> </center>
Instead of focusing on the total effect of an exposure (e.g. HIV status) on outcome (e.g. age of sexual maturity), one may also be interested in understanding the effect through some intermediate variable (e.g. height). Causal queries of this type require stringent assumptions about the relationships between these variables that may not hold in the absence of a randomized trial (e.g. socioeconomic status may induce an association between HIV status and height). The methods developed here seek to clarify and relax the assumptions needed for identification of causal effects.

<center> <strong style="font-size: 135%;"> Network causal effects </strong>  </center>
This work provides methodology to estimate network causal effects in the presence of arbitrary forms of interference, whereby the outcome of one individual may depend on interventions received by other individuals; and long range dependence, whereby outcomes for any two individuals in the network may be dependent. We apply our methods to a sexual and injection drug use network to evaluate the effect of incarceration on HIV and STI transmission.
